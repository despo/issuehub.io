# issuehub.io

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/despo/issuehub.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/despo/issuehub.io)

[**issuehub.io**](http://issuehub.io) is a small project that enables you to find GitHub issues to work on. Unlike other contributing projects, the focus is on labelled issues rather than projects.

The reason for making this project is to encourage issue labelling on open source projects, so that people with different types of experience and knowledge levels can easily find something to help out with.

## Contributing

To contribute, pick one of the open issues (if any exist) and fix the bugs to the best of your ability. You can also improve the interface, refactor the code, or improve test coverage! 

If there is something else that you would like to work on, or if you would like to improve **issuehub** in other ways, open an issue first so we can discuss it.
